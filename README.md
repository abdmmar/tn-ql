# tn-ql

ðŸ”´ Unofficial GraphQL API for Indonesia National Park

## Development

Install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

Then, start development server on locahost:4000

```
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

**tn-ql** use docker, docker-compose, and caddy to make deployment a bit easier.

If you already have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine:

- First, change domain with yours or use localhost on `Caddyfile`

  ```
  // Change the domain below with your domain or just use localhost
  // To use localhost, change to :port e.g. :4040

  tnql.abdmmar.tech {
    // server:4000 is the docker container running the Node.js application, in this case it's exposed on port 4000

    reverse_proxy server:4000
  }
  ```

- Then, create volume because Caddy use the external data

  ```
  docker volume create caddy_data
  ```

- Finally, run the container

  ```
  docker-compose up -d --build
  ```
